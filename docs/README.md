## Archived Documentation (`/archived/`)

Historical implementation documents from previous phases:
- `PHASE_1_1_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Enhanced LLM integration implementation
- `PHASE_1_2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Factory pattern implementation
- `TASK_2_4_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - API endpoint evolution details
- `TASK_2_5_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Frontend adaptation details
- `BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Historical bug fixes and solutions

## Documentation Philosophy

**Single Source of Truth**: `IMPLEMENTATION.md` is maintained as the current authoritative guide
**Historical Preservation**: Archived documents provide development history and context
**Living Documentation**: Active documents are updated with each significant change
**Developer-Focused**: Technical depth for development team while maintaining accessibility

## Updating Documentation

When making significant changes:
1. Update `IMPLEMENTATION.md` with current state
2. Archive old implementation details if they become obsolete
3. Maintain historical context in archived documents
4. Update relevant capability matrices and roadmaps

This structure ensures both current developers and future team members have access to complete project context while maintaining clarity about what is current versus historical.
